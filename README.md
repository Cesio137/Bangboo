# Bangboo Discord Bot

An intelligent Discord bot built with TypeScript.

Hi, Iâ€™m @NathanMiguel, and Iâ€™m developing a bot to help me moderate my community, play music, and streamline some tasks using AI.

This project is currently for my personal use, but I hope to monetize it in the future. ðŸ˜„

## Scripts

- `dev`: running bot in development
- `build`: build the project
- `watch`: running in watch mode
- `start`: running the compiled bot
